NOT AN EXECUTABLE FILE

Please run [cloc *.ml*].  Any file in a subdirectory isn't to be counted as 
live code for our submission.

It must be added that when you'll be looking at the parser, it'll look like a 
mess of duplicated code at first glance, and ripe LOC garnering grounds; 
however, each line is an important part of the parsing.  Newlines are,
unfortunately, counted as a syntactic part of the language, and so we allowed
multiple forms of every definition to allow for flexibility with newlines when 
it shouldn't create an issue.  A clarified version of this is present in the 
readme README.md, and you're welcome to verify that each line is accounted for.

As a sidenote, we have many [.vl] files which represent executable scripts for 
our language, and may be run through [EXEC "filename"] where "filename.vl" is
the file to be executed.  They are not picked up in [cloc], and you may not 
count them; however, their consideration as code written for the assignment 
would be greatly appreciated as they took manhours as well to complete, and are 
a functioning part of our submission.

Thanks!
