NOT AN EXECUTABLE FILE

Please run [cloc *.ml*], as we have dead code in directory legacy-files/.  These
files represent time that we put into the project as a whole, and we didn't
fully delete them partially so we have our old code for reference/if something
goes wrong and partially so we'll have a record of all the work we did that we
did in hubris and had to throw out when we learned a better way to do it.
None of them play any role in our current project as it stands though.

As a sidenote, we have many [.txt] files which represent executable scripts for 
our language, and may be run through [EXEC "filename"] where "filename.txt" is
the file to be executed.  They are not picked up in [cloc], and you may not 
count them; however, their consideration as code written for the assignment 
would be greatly appreciated as they took manhours as well to complete, and are 
a functioning part of our submission.

Thanks!
